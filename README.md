# Actions on Google Java Client Library - Alpha release
This is an Alpha release of the Actions on Google Java client library.
The APIs presented are not to be considered stable; we might make breaking changes
to address feedback from the Actions on Google developers community.

This client library makes it easy to create your apps for the Google Assistant, and
supports both Dialogflow fulfillment and the Actions SDK webhook.

Note: this README is work in progress.
